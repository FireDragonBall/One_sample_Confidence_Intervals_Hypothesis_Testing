# One_sample_Confidence_Intervals_Hypothesis_Testing

Project Description
Using the Data worksheet found in the Module 4 Project_US Population.xlsx Excel
workbook, complete the following analysesâ€™ regarding US Occupations. Incorporate the
results into your report.
In some parts of this project, you are asked to create random samples from a given
population. Random sampling methods have been covered in Module 3.
Part 1
Use the random sampling method to generate a random sample of size 45 from the given
International Migration Rates. Then calculate the population mean, the variance and
standard deviation of the population.
Part 2
Using the random sample from Part 1, complete the following analysis of the data.
1. Calculate the sample mean, sample standard deviation, sample size and sampling
(standard) error.
2. Use the sample to create 92%, 96% and 98% confidence intervals for the population
mean.
3. For each of the confidence intervals in step 2, use the information already calculated
to determine the sample size needed to estimate the population mean to within .05
units.
In your report, explain your solution procedures and findings. Explain whether any of the
confidence intervals created in Step 2 does not contain the population mean.
Part 3
1. Use the random sampling method to generate a random sample of size 25 from the
given International Migration Rates in the dataset. Then calculate the sample mean,
sample standard deviation, sample size, degrees of freedom and sampling error.
2. Use the sample to calculate margin of error, upper and lower confidence interval limit
for 92%, 96% and 98% confidence intervals for the population mean. You should
know whether to use a z or t value.
In your report, explain your solution procedures and findings. Explain whether any of the
confidence intervals created in Step 2 does not contain the population mean calculated in
Part 1.
Part 4
1. Use the random sampling method to generate a random sample of size 150 from the
given International Migration Rates in the dataset. Calculate the sample proportion that
are less than 1 for the random sample.
2. Calculate the sample proportion of counties whose international migration rate (per
1000) is greater than 2.
3. Calculate the sample proportion of success, the sample proportion of failure, sample
size and sampling error.
4. Using the sample to create a 90%, a 95%, and 99% confidence intervals for the
population proportion of counties whose international migration rate (per 1000) is
greater than 2 in the designated cells. Calculate the margin of error, upper and lower CI
Limit and CI width.
5. Determine the minimum sample size needed to estimate the population proportion of
interest to within 8%. Do this for each confidence interval above. Assume that there is
no prior knowledge about the proportion of counties whose international migration
rate (per 1000) is greater than 2.
6. Calculate the population proportion of success and the population proportion of failure.
In your report, explain your solution procedures and findings and state whether any of the
confidence intervals created in Step 4 above does not contain the population proportion of
interest.
Part 5
1. Use the random sampling method to generate a random sample of size 22 from the
given population.
2. Calculate the sample variance, sample standard deviation, and degrees of freedom.
3. Use the sample to create 92%, 96% and 98% confidence intervals for the population
variance and standard deviation.
In your report, explain your solution procedures and findings. Explain whether any of the
confidence intervals created for the population standard deviation in Step 2 above does not
contain the population standard deviation.
Part 6
Use the sample in Part 1 to test the hypothesis that the average migration rate (per 1000)
in the population is greater than 1. Use alpha = 0.05.
In your report, explain your hypothesis testing methods, procedures, and findings. In
particular, describe the meaning of the calculated P-value in the context of this problem.
Part 7
Use the sample in Part 3 to test the hypothesis that the population average migration rate
(per 1000) is less than 1.5. Use alpha = 0.02.
In your report, explain your hypothesis testing methods, procedures, and findings.
Part 8
Use the sample in part 4 to test the hypothesis that less than 20% of the US counties have a
migration rate that is higher than 2 (in 1000). Use alpha = 0.03.
In your report, explain your hypothesis testing methods, procedures, and findings.
Part 9
Use the sample in Part 5 to test the hypothesis that the standard deviation of the
population emigration rates (in 1000) is different from 1.2. Use alpha = 0.05.
In your report, explain your hypothesis testing methods, procedures, and findings.
